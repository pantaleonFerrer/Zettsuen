Hi, my name is Pantaleon Ferrer,

I'm currently a software engineer who prefers to work in back-end instead of front-end, but I can do front-end too (without Design pls).

My most important developmental languages are.

- Typescript
- Node.js with TS
- Python

And I know how to develop with

- Express
- Django
- Flask
- Vue
- React
- Sockets
- AWS
- CI/CD
- Lambda

And much more, but not this concern.
